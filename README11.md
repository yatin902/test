# BloXmove Dev : Usage of Verifiable Credentials
Attestations in the MBP basic business architecture can be represented by off-chain verifiable credentials according to the W3C specification, especially when their content contains sensitive information that should not be visible on a ledger.
The following describes the technical flows of verifiable credential issuance and validation, using the example of user claims (driverLicense, minAge) that a service consumer gets attested by a KYC Provider and presents it to the Fleet Node for proving to fulfil the requirements to rent a car.

## Issuance: User gets Verifiable Credential(s) from KYC Provider
The flow above assumes the user already has a private/public key pair and associated DID in the Fleet2Share (F2S) app. The F2S App triggers a request to get verifications from the Sample KYC Service, passing on the user DID, some proof data about the claims, and a signature by the private/public key pair that is associated to the user DID. The Sample KYC Service resolves the user DID to validate it exists and retrieve the public key(s) authorised to sign on behalf of this DID. With that information, the Sample KYC Service can validate the signature.

After successfully validating the real-world proofs, the Sample KYC Service creates the Verifiable Credentials and adds a proof signed with a private/public key pair that belongs to the DID of the KYC Provider. Every VC gets a unique identifier and can be optionally “anchored” in a Credential Registry Contract on the blockchain, which typically stores the unique identifier along with the issuer identity and the credential status information. The issuer can then later update the status of the credential and thus revoke it.

The VCs are returned to the F2S app, where they are stored in the wallet.

A VC returned could look like the following (using ethr for the DIDs):

```javascript
{
 "@context": [ "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1" ],
  "type": [ "VerifiableCredential", "DriverLicenseCredential" ],
  // unique identifier of the VC
  "id": "6e90a3e2bf3823e52eceb0f81373eb58b1a0a238965f0d4388ab9ce9ceeddfd3",  
  "issuer": "did:ethr:blxm-dev:0x76fF7A937699D5Fdc02E70B23450deF8F321d3fB",
  "credentialSubject": {
    // id of the main subject of the claim
    "id": "did:ethr:blxm-dev:0xEc1818147dA3B090049d08059966bd6B2E6Cc4F9",
    "driverLicense": true
  },
  "validFrom": "2020-02-25T09:48:57.660Z",
  "proof": { 
    // signature by issuer
    "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1RecoveryMethod2020",
    "created": "2020-02-25T09:48:58.451Z",
    "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
    // this marks the public key in the DID document of the issuer to validate the issuer's signature
    "verificationMethod": "did:ethr:blxm-dev:0x76fF7A937699D5Fdc02E70B23450deF8F321d3fB#controller",
    // actual signature value
    "proofValue": "0xe55b271d5ebe3341b8f6d6fcf2468fb5c4308fe121d63ece6f65db93d8ef355e058cd317d81c2f0fb501f41727672ff1d5daa6c90b5f79f79ac28eb3e326cbae1c" 
  } 
}
```

## Validation: Fleet Node validates claims
The flow above assumes that the Fleet Node is configured with a list of trusted issuer DIDs, i.e. the ids of KYC Services or Id Providers the Fleet Operator trusts.
The validation is done as part of a user request, e.g. the F2S app requesting the rental of a car. In the payload of this request the F2S app passes on a Verifiable Presentation of the previously received VCs signed by the private/public key pair that belongs to the user DID. The Verifiable Presentation could look like the example below.
```javascript
{
  "@context": [ "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1" ],
  "type": "VerifiablePresentation",
  "verifiableCredential": [
    ...
    // full verifiable credential object from above
    ...
  ],
  "proof": [{
    "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1RecoveryMethod2020",
    "created": "2020-03-18T21:19:10Z",
    "proofPurpose": "authentication",
    // this marks the public key in the DID document of the user to validate the user's signature
    "verificationMethod": "did:ethr:blxm-dev:0x76fF7A937699D5Fdc02E70B23450deF8F321d3fB#controller",
    // user signature value
    "proofValue": "0xab4..."
  }]
}
```

The Fleet Node validates the information in the following way:
- Check if any of the presented VCs is expired
- For each of the VCs, verify that the issuer id is in the list of trusted issuers
- Resolve user DID, validate existence of user DID and user signature in proof of Verifiable Presentation
- For each of the VCs, resolve the issuer DID, validate existence of issuer DID and issuer signature in proof of VC
- (Optional in case of revocation): For each of the VCs, check the Credential Registry Contract for the status, validate it has the expected status
If one of the checks or validations fails, the Fleet Node should reject the request.

## DID Resolver and Credential Registry Contract
The DID Resolver and Credential Registry Contract components mentioned in the previous description are indicated to make the functionality more clear. In practice they are both part of the underlying blockchain network implementation (e.g. Ethereum, Ontology) and should be abstracted in the Asset Service implementation.
